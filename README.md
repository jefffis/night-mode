The Night Mode Cometh: make your site easier on the eyes at night.

## Just add night
Include the night-mode script to your site, then between 8pm and 6am, your users will be able to enable Night Mode. If it's enabled, it will automatically show for the users entire session (unless it's between 6am and 8pm) until they turn it off.
